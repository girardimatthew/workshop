%It returns a row vector, and each element of it is the sum of one column of the matrix
%If the input is a vector, sum(vectorX) returns a scalar
%sum() is polymorphic, but the output that it returns doesn't have the same
%as its input
a = max([1 2 -4 8])
a =
     8
%max() returns the maximum number in that vector 
[a b] = max([1 2 -4 8])
a =
     8
b =
     4
%b is the index of the maximum number
s = size([1 2; 3 4; 0 -2])
s =
     3     2
%s is a vector, this is a 3-by-2 matrix, so it returns that vector, 3, 2

%save the elements of its output in another way
%number of rows in row
%size behaves differently depending on the number of output arguments we ask for
