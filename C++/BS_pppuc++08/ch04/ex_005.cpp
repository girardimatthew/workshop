// Write a program that performs as a very simple calculator. 
// Your calcula足tor should be able to handle the five basic math operations 
// - add, sub足 tract, multiply, divide, and modulus (remainder) - on two input values. 
// Your program should prompt the user to enter three arguments: 
// two double values and a character to represent an operation. 
// If the entry ar足 guments are 35.6, 24.1, and '+', the program output should be "The sum of 35.6 and 24.1 is 59.7." 
// In Chapter 6 we look at a much more sophisti足 cated simple calculator.
