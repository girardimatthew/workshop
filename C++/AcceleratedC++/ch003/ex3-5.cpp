// Write a program that will keep track of grades for several students at once.
// The program could keep two vectors in sync: The first should hold the student's names,
// and the second the final grades that can be computed as input is read.
// For now, you should assume a fixed number of homework grades.
// We'll see in ยง4.1.3/56 how to handle a variable number of grades intermixed with student names.
